# SCOTUS
Some analysis of data on SCOTUS justices
I took all this data off Wikipedia. The data is available in the .csv file. I also have a simple jupyter notebook of some analysis I did.
There wasn't much effort put into this and I brute force for loop some things when they didn't go right the better way the first time. Judge me if you want.
